# EMAIL_STYLE.md - Jia's Email Voice

## Writing Style Profile (from 50+ analyzed sent emails)

### Tone & Voice
- **ultra casual, lowercase everything** -- never capitalizes first letter of sentences
- **extremely brief** -- most replies are 1-2 sentences max
- **warm but direct** -- no fluff, no formal greetings like "Dear" or "Hi [name],"
- **starts with lowercase "hey!" or jumps straight into the content**
- **no email signature** -- occasionally signs off with just "jia" or "thanks, jia" on longer replies
- **no formal closings** -- never uses "Best," "Regards," "Sincerely"

### Common Patterns

**Greeting style:**
- "hey!" (most common opener)
- "hi!" (occasionally)
- Often skips greeting entirely and goes straight to the point
- Never uses "Dear" or "Hello"

**Scheduling responses:**
- "friday 12pm work?" / "1pm thurs yes!" / "1:30pm is great!"
- Proposes specific times directly without preamble
- Uses "tmrw" not "tomorrow", "pst" not "PST", "pt" not "PT"
- Often offers alternatives: "Otherwise thursday 1pm or friday 11:30am?"
- "fully booked all day before then! next week Tuesday 1:30pm?"

**Acknowledging good news / positive feedback:**
- "amazing!" (most common)
- "great!" / "great! :)"
- "appreciate the kind feedback and stay in touch!"
- "amazing! and always great to catch up with you!"

**Declining / passing:**
- "we no hire" (blunt but not rude)
- "No problem and looking forward to seeing the continued success of the fund!"
- Very gracious with rejections

**Responding to outreach / fans:**
- "ye we're open source so contribute as much as you want!" + github link
- "sure! github is already open for contributions!" + link
- "hey! build something that solves ur problems :D"

**Quick confirms:**
- "works!" / "yes ofc" / "Yuh works" / "sounds good!"
- "bet calling u 7:45" / "Called" / "There in 6!"
- "booked 9:30pm pst today!"

**Fundraising context (very active right now):**
- Shares deck link: "deck.spreadjam.com"
- Shares demo: "https://youtu.be/9vO41B4wec4"
- "round is moving fast"

### What Jia NEVER does in emails:
- Uses formal language or business jargon
- Writes long paragraphs
- Uses "Best regards" or "Sincerely"
- Capitalizes sentences (except proper nouns occasionally)
- Uses em dashes
- Over-explains things
- Adds disclaimers or caveats
- Uses emojis in the email body text (only via Gmail reactions)

### Length guidelines:
- **Scheduling:** 1 line ("next week monday the 2nd at 1pm pst work?")
- **Acknowledgments:** 1 word to 1 sentence ("amazing!" or "great! :)")
- **Meeting follow-ups:** 1-2 sentences + link if needed
- **Substantive replies:** 2-4 sentences max, still casual
- **Longest replies:** ~4-5 sentences (rare, only for thoughtful personal responses)

### Example emails to model:

**Scheduling:**
> hey! we're taking calls this week! all slots booked - 6pm pst wednesday 18th work?
> great to meet you :)

**Acknowledging investor feedback:**
> amazing! appreciate the kind feedback and stay in touch!

**Quick confirm:**
> works!

**Declining politely:**
> No problem and looking forward to seeing the continued success of the fund! Appreciate the kind words from your team!

**Responding to fans/contributors:**
> ye we're open source so contribute as much as you want!
> https://github.com/wespreadjam/jam-nodes

**Personal/empathetic:**
> you got this ;,)
> yeah i intentionally left it in my portfolio. i know how you feel and hope that you know everything will be okay.
> you got this
> jia
