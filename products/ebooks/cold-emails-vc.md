# Cold Emails That Got Us VC Meetings

## Real Templates + Teardowns from a YC-Backed Founder

---

# Introduction

I've sent hundreds of cold emails to investors. Most got ignored. Some got meetings. A few got checks.

This guide contains the exact emails that worked—not theory, not templates from blogs, but real emails I sent that led to actual meetings with top-tier VCs.

You'll learn:
- The anatomy of emails that get responses
- Why most cold emails fail (and how to fix them)
- Real templates you can adapt
- Follow-up sequences that don't feel desperate

# Chapter 1: Why Most Cold Emails Fail

**The typical cold email:**
```
Subject: Intro - [Startup Name]

Hi [Partner Name],

I'm the founder of [Startup], an AI-powered platform that 
revolutionizes [buzzword] for [market]. We're raising a 
$2M seed round and would love to chat.

We have:
- 10x growth
- Amazing team
- Huge TAM

Would you have 15 minutes this week?

Best,
[Name]
```

**Why it fails:**
1. **No hook** - Nothing interesting in first line
2. **Generic** - Could be sent to any VC
3. **All about you** - They don't care (yet)
4. **No social proof** - Why should they believe you?
5. **Weak ask** - "15 minutes" = meetings that go nowhere

# Chapter 2: The Anatomy of Emails That Work

## The Hook (First Line)

They read on their phone. You have 5 words to earn the next sentence.

**Bad hooks:**
- "I'm reaching out because..."
- "I hope this email finds you well"
- "I'm the founder of..."

**Good hooks:**
- "[Mutual connection] suggested I reach out"
- "Saw your tweet about [specific thing]—we're building exactly that"
- "[Impressive metric] in [short time]"
- "Your portfolio company [X] is a customer"

## The Bridge (Why You, Why Now)

Connect YOUR thing to THEIR interests. Research them:
- Recent investments
- Tweets/content they post
- Thesis areas
- Companies they've passed on

## The Proof (Why Believe You)

One impressive fact beats five mediocre ones:
- Revenue or growth number
- Notable customer/user
- Team credential
- Unique insight

## The Ask (Specific and Easy)

Not "15 minutes" but:
- "Quick call this Thursday or Friday?"
- "Mind if I send our deck?"
- "Would you intro me to [specific person at their firm]?"

# Chapter 3: Real Emails That Worked

## Email #1: The Mutual Connection Angle

**Context:** Cold email to a top seed fund, got meeting within 24 hours

```
Subject: [Founder Name] suggested I reach out

Hi [Partner],

[Mutual founder] mentioned you've been interested in 
AI agent infrastructure.

We just crossed $30k MRR (3x in 60 days) letting developers 
deploy Claude-powered agents to Discord/Slack/SMS in minutes. 
Open source core, hosted offering.

[Founder]'s using us for [specific use case].

Worth a quick call? Free Thursday afternoon.

[Name]
```

**Why it worked:**
- Mutual connection in subject AND first line
- Specific to their thesis (AI infrastructure)
- Concrete metric with growth rate
- Social proof (named founder using it)
- Easy, specific ask

---

## Email #2: The Portfolio Connection

**Context:** Their portfolio company was a customer

```
Subject: We power [Portfolio Co]'s AI features

Hi [Partner],

[Portfolio Co] has been using our API for 4 months—
they mentioned you might want to see what we're building.

We're [one-line description]. $50k MRR, growing 40% monthly, 
12 paying companies including [2-3 names].

Happy to share more context. Free Wednesday?

[Name]
```

**Why it worked:**
- Portfolio company = instant credibility
- They'll ask their portfolio company about you
- Feels like a warm intro, not cold email

---

## Email #3: The Contrarian Insight

**Context:** Sharing a non-obvious insight relevant to their thesis

```
Subject: why AI agents will be sold, not built

Hi [Partner],

Everyone's building AI agent frameworks. We think that's wrong.

After talking to 100+ companies trying to deploy agents, the 
problem isn't building them—it's operating them. Reliability, 
monitoring, debugging.

We're the Datadog for AI agents. 8 enterprise pilots, 
$100k pipeline.

Thesis deck attached if interesting.

[Name]
```

**Why it worked:**
- Contrarian take grabs attention
- Shows customer insight (100+ conversations)
- Clear analogy (Datadog for X)
- Proof via pipeline, not just idea

---

## Email #4: The Twitter Reply → Email

**Context:** VC tweeted about topic, I engaged, then emailed

```
Subject: re: your tweet on AI UX

Hey [Partner],

Enjoyed the thread on AI UX patterns—especially the point 
about progressive disclosure.

We're actually shipping exactly what you described: AI agents 
that ask clarifying questions before acting. Reduces errors 
by 60% in our testing.

[Demo link] - 2 min video

Would love your take. Worth a call?

[Name]
```

**Why it worked:**
- Reference to THEIR content (they care about it)
- You're building what they theorize about
- Demo link = low-commitment ask
- Flattery that doesn't feel gross

# Chapter 4: The Follow-Up Sequence

Most meetings come from follow-ups, not first emails.

## Day 3: The Bump

```
Subject: Re: [original subject]

Bumping this up—any interest?

[Name]
```

Short. Not desperate.

## Day 7: Add New Information

```
Subject: Re: [original subject]

Quick update since last email—we just signed [notable customer] 
and crossed $[X] MRR.

Still happy to chat if there's interest.

[Name]
```

New info = new reason to respond.

## Day 14: The Break-Up

```
Subject: Re: [original subject]

Closing the loop—will assume timing isn't right if I 
don't hear back.

Happy to reconnect down the road.

[Name]
```

Creates urgency without being pushy.

# Chapter 5: Subject Line Formulas

**What works:**
- `[Mutual person] suggested I reach out`
- `re: your tweet about [topic]`
- `[Portfolio company] → [your company]`
- `[Impressive number] in [timeframe]`
- `[Simple description of what you do]`

**What doesn't:**
- `Quick question`
- `Intro - [Company]`
- `Partnership opportunity`
- `[Your Company] - AI [Buzzword] Platform`
- Anything with emojis

---

# Chapter 6: Research Shortcuts

## Before emailing, spend 5 minutes:

1. **Twitter/X** - What do they tweet about? Recent takes?
2. **Recent investments** - Any in your space?
3. **Podcast appearances** - What's their thesis?
4. **Their portfolio** - Anyone you know? Any customers?
5. **Mutual connections** - LinkedIn 2nd degrees?

## Red flags (don't email):

- Firm doesn't invest in your stage
- Partner focuses on different sector
- They just invested in a competitor
- Firm is clearly not deploying
