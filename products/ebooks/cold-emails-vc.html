<h1>Cold Emails That Got Us VC Meetings</h1>
<p></p>
<h2>Real Templates + Teardowns from a YC-Backed Founder</h2>
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p></p>
I've sent hundreds of cold emails to investors. Most got ignored. Some got meetings. A few got checks.
<p></p>
This guide contains the exact emails that worked—not theory, not templates from blogs, but real emails I sent that led to actual meetings with top-tier VCs.
<p></p>
You'll learn:
<li>The anatomy of emails that get responses</li>
<li>Why most cold emails fail (and how to fix them)</li>
<li>Real templates you can adapt</li>
<li>Follow-up sequences that don't feel desperate</li>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h1>Chapter 1: Why Most Cold Emails Fail</h1>
<p></p>
<strong>The typical cold email:</strong>
<pre><code>
Subject: Intro - [Startup Name]
<p></p>
Hi [Partner Name],
<p></p>
I'm the founder of [Startup], an AI-powered platform that 
revolutionizes [buzzword] for [market]. We're raising a 
$2M seed round and would love to chat.
<p></p>
We have:
<li>10x growth</li>
<li>Amazing team</li>
<li>Huge TAM</li>
<p></p>
Would you have 15 minutes this week?
<p></p>
Best,
[Name]
<pre><code>
<p></p>
<strong>Why it fails:</strong>
1. **No hook** - Nothing interesting in first line
2. **Generic** - Could be sent to any VC
3. **All about you** - They don't care (yet)
4. **No social proof** - Why should they believe you?
5. **Weak ask** - "15 minutes" = meetings that go nowhere
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<h1>Chapter 2: The Anatomy of Emails That Work</h1>
<p></p>
<h2>The Hook (First Line)</h2>
<p></p>
They read on their phone. You have 5 words to earn the next sentence.
<p></p>
<strong>Bad hooks:</strong>
<li>"I'm reaching out because..."</li>
<li>"I hope this email finds you well"</li>
<li>"I'm the founder of..."</li>
<p></p>
<strong>Good hooks:</strong>
<li>"[Mutual connection] suggested I reach out"</li>
<li>"Saw your tweet about [specific thing]—we're building exactly that"</li>
<li>"[Impressive metric] in [short time]"</li>
<li>"Your portfolio company [X] is a customer"</li>
<p></p>
<h2>The Bridge (Why You, Why Now)</h2>
<p></p>
Connect YOUR thing to THEIR interests. Research them:
<li>Recent investments</li>
<li>Tweets/content they post</li>
<li>Thesis areas</li>
<li>Companies they've passed on</li>
<p></p>
<h2>The Proof (Why Believe You)</h2>
<p></p>
One impressive fact beats five mediocre ones:
<li>Revenue or growth number</li>
<li>Notable customer/user</li>
<li>Team credential</li>
<li>Unique insight</li>
<p></p>
<h2>The Ask (Specific and Easy)</h2>
<p></p>
Not "15 minutes" but:
<li>"Quick call this Thursday or Friday?"</li>
<li>"Mind if I send our deck?"</li>
<li>"Would you intro me to [specific person at their firm]?"</li>
<p></p>

<h1>Chapter 3: Real Emails That Worked</h1>
<p></p>
<h2>Email #1: The Mutual Connection Angle</h2>
<p></p>
**Context:** Cold email to a top seed fund, got meeting within 24 hours
<p></p>
<pre><code>
Subject: [Founder Name] suggested I reach out
<p></p>
Hi [Partner],
<p></p>
[Mutual founder] mentioned you've been interested in 
AI agent infrastructure.
<p></p>
We just crossed $30k MRR (3x in 60 days) letting developers 
deploy Claude-powered agents to Discord/Slack/SMS in minutes. 
Open source core, hosted offering.
<p></p>
[Founder]'s using us for [specific use case].
<p></p>
Worth a quick call? Free Thursday afternoon.
<p></p>
[Name]
<pre><code>
<p></p>
<strong>Why it worked:</strong>
<li>Mutual connection in subject AND first line</li>
<li>Specific to their thesis (AI infrastructure)</li>
<li>Concrete metric with growth rate</li>
<li>Social proof (named founder using it)</li>
<li>Easy, specific ask</li>
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<h2>Email #2: The Portfolio Connection</h2>
<p></p>
**Context:** Their portfolio company was a customer
<p></p>
<pre><code>
Subject: We power [Portfolio Co]'s AI features
<p></p>
Hi [Partner],
<p></p>
[Portfolio Co] has been using our API for 4 months—
they mentioned you might want to see what we're building.
<p></p>
We're [one-line description]. $50k MRR, growing 40% monthly, 
12 paying companies including [2-3 names].
<p></p>
Happy to share more context. Free Wednesday?
<p></p>
[Name]
<pre><code>
<p></p>
<strong>Why it worked:</strong>
<li>Portfolio company = instant credibility</li>
<li>They'll ask their portfolio company about you</li>
<li>Feels like a warm intro, not cold email</li>
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<h2>Email #3: The Contrarian Insight</h2>
<p></p>
**Context:** Sharing a non-obvious insight relevant to their thesis
<p></p>
<pre><code>
Subject: why AI agents will be sold, not built
<p></p>
Hi [Partner],
<p></p>
Everyone's building AI agent frameworks. We think that's wrong.
<p></p>
After talking to 100+ companies trying to deploy agents, the 
problem isn't building them—it's operating them. Reliability, 
monitoring, debugging.
<p></p>
We're the Datadog for AI agents. 8 enterprise pilots, 
$100k pipeline.
<p></p>
Thesis deck attached if interesting.
<p></p>
[Name]
<pre><code>
<p></p>
<strong>Why it worked:</strong>
<li>Contrarian take grabs attention</li>
<li>Shows customer insight (100+ conversations)</li>
<li>Clear analogy (Datadog for X)</li>
<li>Proof via pipeline, not just idea</li>
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<h2>Email #4: The Twitter Reply → Email</h2>
<p></p>
**Context:** VC tweeted about topic, I engaged, then emailed
<p></p>
<pre><code>
Subject: re: your tweet on AI UX
<p></p>
Hey [Partner],
<p></p>
Enjoyed the thread on AI UX patterns—especially the point 
about progressive disclosure.
<p></p>
We're actually shipping exactly what you described: AI agents 
that ask clarifying questions before acting. Reduces errors 
by 60% in our testing.
<p></p>
[Demo link] - 2 min video
<p></p>
Would love your take. Worth a call?
<p></p>
[Name]
<pre><code>
<p></p>
<strong>Why it worked:</strong>
<li>Reference to THEIR content (they care about it)</li>
<li>You're building what they theorize about</li>
<li>Demo link = low-commitment ask</li>
<li>Flattery that doesn't feel gross</li>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h1>Chapter 4: The Follow-Up Sequence</h1>
<p></p>
Most meetings come from follow-ups, not first emails.
<p></p>
<h2>Day 3: The Bump</h2>
<p></p>
<pre><code>
Subject: Re: [original subject]
<p></p>
Bumping this up—any interest?
<p></p>
[Name]
<pre><code>
<p></p>
Short. Not desperate.
<p></p>
<h2>Day 7: Add New Information</h2>
<p></p>
<pre><code>
Subject: Re: [original subject]
<p></p>
Quick update since last email—we just signed [notable customer] 
and crossed $[X] MRR.
<p></p>
Still happy to chat if there's interest.
<p></p>
[Name]
<pre><code>
<p></p>
New info = new reason to respond.
<p></p>
<h2>Day 14: The Break-Up</h2>
<p></p>
<pre><code>
Subject: Re: [original subject]
<p></p>
Closing the loop—will assume timing isn't right if I 
don't hear back.
<p></p>
Happy to reconnect down the road.

<p></p>
