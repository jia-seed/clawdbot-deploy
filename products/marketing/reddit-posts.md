### r/ClaudeAI Post

**Title:** I run 3 Claude agents 24/7 for $4/month - here's how

**Body:**
```
Been running this setup for a few months now and wanted to share.

The setup:
- Hetzner ARM server (€3.79/month)
- 3 Claude agents via API (~$8/month depending on usage)
- Connected to Discord, email, calendar

What they do:
- Monitor and respond to emails in my voice
- Schedule meetings based on my availability
- Remind me of tasks and deadlines
- Run automated checks throughout the day

It's basically like having 3 assistants that never sleep.

I wrote up a step-by-step guide on exactly how to set this up: [link]

Happy to answer questions about the setup or share specific configs.
```

### r/selfhosted Post

**Title:** Self-hosted AI assistant setup - $4/month for 24/7 Claude agents

**Body:**
```
Finally got my AI assistant setup dialed in. Running on a cheap ARM VPS.

Stack:
- Ubuntu 24.04 on Hetzner CAX11 (€3.79/month)
- Clawdbot (open source agent framework)
- Anthropic API for Claude
- Systemd for process management

Features:
- Email monitoring and auto-replies
- Calendar integration
- Discord/Slack bots
- Custom personality and memory

The agents actually remember context between sessions and learn my preferences.

Wrote up a complete guide here: [link]

What are you all using for AI automation?

### r/Entrepreneur Post (Cold Email Guide)

**Title:** The exact cold emails I used to get meetings with top VCs

**Body:**
```
After sending hundreds of cold emails to investors, I compiled the ones that actually worked.

Not templates from blogs - actual emails I sent that got responses and meetings.

Key learnings:
- First 5 words matter more than anything else
- One impressive fact > five mediocre ones  
- Follow-ups get more meetings than first emails
- "15 minutes" is a weak ask - be specific

Also included my follow-up sequence and the research shortcuts I use before each email.

Put it all in a guide: [link]

What's worked for you all with cold outreach?
```

### r/SideProject Post (both products)

**Title:** Weekend project: made 2 ebooks to sell, looking for feedback

**Body:**
```
Spent today putting together two ebooks based on stuff I've learned:

1. "Deploy Your Own AI Assistant for $4/Month" - step by step guide to running Claude agents on a cheap VPS

2. "Cold Emails That Got Us VC Meetings" - real templates that actually got responses

Pricing them at $19 and $14.

Curious:
- Does the pricing feel right?
- What would make you more likely to buy?
- Any subreddits I should share these in?
